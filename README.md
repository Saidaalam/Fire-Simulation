2D Fire Simulation:

This 2D fire simulator combines physical accuracy and visual realism using OpenGL and fluid 
simulation principles. It delivers a responsive and immersive experience that is 
computationally optimized for real-time rendering. 

Applications:
1. Game Development and Visual Effects
2. Fire Safety in Emergency
3. Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR)
4. PU Programming and Academic Learning
5. Experimental Research and Simulation Platforms

Setup:
1. Clone the project
2. Open in Codeblocks (Should remain OpenGL)
3. setup openGL if you don't have (https://youtu.be/ISK6_7YpmS0?si=Ep2cKHs-TObZV2N9)
4. Build and Run
